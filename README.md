# discrete_event_simulation

## Using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to help plan purchasing in an organisation 
**Project Goal** - The objective of this project is to build DES models to simulate the steps in purchasing items in an organisation. The SimPy python library is used in creating this model

All completed work for this project is contained in the `PR_simulation.ipynb` file.

Contents of the PR_simulation.ipynb file
-------------------------------------------

* The [first section](./PR_simulation.ipynb# Using Discrete Event Simulation to help plan purchasing in an organisation ) covers the executive summary and information on the model being built
* The *Stages in building the Purchase Requisition model* describes the steps taken to build the model
* The *Purchase Requisition model* covers the creation of the final model
* Results and analysis are provided in the other sections

How to use
-----------
* Set input parameters in the **Function to launch** section 
* Run simulation in the **Run Simulation environment** sub-section
