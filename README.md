## Using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to Analyze the Process of Procurement in an Organization
**Introduction:** The imbalance in demand and supply following the covid-19 pandemic has affected the internal and external dependecies of some organizations. To keep up with the current surge in demand, and scarce resources, these organizations are seeking ways to optimize various business processes to minimize cost and maximize output in meeting the needs of customers. This project focuses on creating a tool to analyze the flow of purchasing project materials. The results are intended to aid upper management in determining points of high entropy in the system.

**Project Goal** - The objective of this project is to build a tool to simulate the poison process of procurement in an organisation. This project makes use of the SimPy python library.

All completed work for this project is contained in the [Purchase Requisition Simulation](PR_simulation.ipynb). The notebook is also available on the [web](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OsarodionOdion/DES_model/HEAD)
