    "Inorder to purchase items, it is common for organisations to require a set process for its members. Some organisations have dedicated departments and/or employees for this, such as the purchasing department, clerk etc. The title of the responsible entity may differ across organisations, however, the responsibilities tend to be similar. For organisations with a projectized structure, the project coordinators take up this responsibility, and depending on the size of the projectized organisation, other entities such as the finance department and the indirectbuyer can be involved. Here is an example of the flow of purchasing in such an organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Send application/request --> Create Purchase Requisition (PR) --> Approve Purchase Requisition --> place order (if online) --> issue PO to merchants --> Exit\n",
    "\n",
    "Members/Employees of the organisation send applications/requests (by email) to project coordinators. Project Coordinators create **Purchase Requisitions** and route them to finance for approval. Once approved, purchase requisitions for items that are to be purchased online are routed to project coordinators to place order. Approved purchase requisitions are routed to the indirect buyers of the organisation to issue **Purchase Orders**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this model, the above flow will be adpoted. Here are the model components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The entities are applications\n",
    "* Entities are created when applications/requests are sent to project coordinators\n",
    "* Each stage of the process has a set number of resources such as project coordinators, members of the finance department responsible for reviewing and approving PRs, project coordinators to place online orders, and Indirect buyers to issue POs\n",
    "* Entities flow through different stages of the purchase requisition process, and at each stage, they:\n",
    "    - request one unit of the appropriate type of staff resource and wait if one is not available,\n",
    "    - after obtaining a staff resource they delay for some amount of time for the process to be completed,\n",
    "    - when the processing time has elapsed, the resource is released and the PR moves on to the next stage of the purchase requisition process (Mark Isken, 2021)\n",
    "* After the PO has been issued, the process ends for that PR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model should handle:\n",
    "* Uncertainty in the processing times of the individual steps above\n",
    "* Uncertainty in the application arrival times\n",
    "* Finite number of different types of resources\n",
    "* ability to estimate key process metrics such as application wait times, total time for completion, resource utilisation (Mark Isken, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "Model characteristics\n",
    "* The python library used for this model is __[SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)__\n",
    "* The arrival of applications is exponentially distributed *Poisson arrival process* (exponential distribution)\n",
    "* The time for the other stages (approve PR, place order, issue PO) are modeled as a normal distribution with the given mean and standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
